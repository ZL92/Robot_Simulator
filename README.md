# Robot_Simulator


The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Control speed of motors of left and right wheel with following keyboard

```
W: positive increment of left wheel motor speed
S: negative increment of left wheel motor speed
O: positive increment of right wheel motor speed
L: negative increment of right wheel motor speed
X: both motor speeds are zero
T: positive increment of both wheels’ motor speed
G: negative increment of both wheels’ motor speed
```


Note:

In this simulation, four borders (red lines) are placed. Inside borders, the obstacles are representating as lines. To change the obstacle for testing, for now, you need to change pairs of the points, for example (start_pointP, end_pointP) and (start_point, end_point)
