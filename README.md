# Robot_Simulator

## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note:
In this simulation, four borders (red lines) are placed. Inside borders, the obstacles are representating as lines. To change the obstacle for testing, for now, you need to change pairs of the points, for example (start_pointP, end_pointP) and (start_point, end_point)
